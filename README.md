Any Deck provides users with the ability to populate index cards on a subject they are interested in learning better, and the program will help users memorize and implement in a fun, easy to use way.

//Issues

1. toggleClass isn't working properly so that the answer is hidden when a new question card is clicked. I will fix this so that a user won't be able to see the answer unless they click the 'Answer' button.

2. Version where user can generate their own content needs work. 

3. Eventually need to change the interface, and combine the two cards into one card, so that a user can click a button to see the front (question) and back (answer) to test themselves.

4.
