Questions for Ilias

Random question generated in the 'question' function
Need not random answer (the answer corresponding with that question) to appear in 'answer' function (right now it's the same function as the random question generator, but selecting the choices )

-->and then using that variable locate the answer property corresponding to that question's index?
